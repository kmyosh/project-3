# [Culinarian](https://culinarian-sei55.herokuapp.com/)


### Introduction

_In Canada people waste an estimated [$30 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-food-waste-1.3813965) of food every year._

_The average Canadian spends almost [$3,000](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110012501) every year on dining out._

Culinarian keeps cooking simple.

Using a Django, Python, and PostgreSQL as our solutions-stack, our team of 4 software developers launched a recipe-based website that aims to streamline decision-making in the kitchen and mitigate food waste. Users have access to a large database of recipes that suggests popular recipes and exact portions of ingredients for their next grocery run.

### About the Project
This project was built in 7 days. Working within a team of 4, along with two UX Designers, Nick Collett and Karishma Jani, we organized our project by first creating a [wireframe](https://www.figma.com/file/KmUPhWQxVPztGLhFxzJMVN/Collabathon?node-id=167%3A813), mapping an [ERD](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/78f5650d-cdb2-45c6-a92a-3285be5d8009/edit?viewport_loc=-1706%2C-645%2C2493%2C1122%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_b0952405-cfc6-4620-8334-bb4c4707eb1a), and organizing our tasks for the minimum viable product (MVP) using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/f802231124e345e38edb4db5b1e4b008?v=12e1bfb756a147a88750053b30b02be1). Following an Agile workflow, our team met daily during project week to touch base on task progress, issues faced, and mapping out next steps.   

### Responsibilities

For the UI/UX, we took a mobile-first approach to create a responsive website using HTML, CSS, and Materialize’s styling framework. I was responsible for creating AJAX calls to our database and populating the data within Django's templates. 

I was tasked with creating RESTful APIs so users can collect recipes into their "My Recipes" page, create meal plans in their "My Meal Plans" page, and generate grocery lists from their collections.

Following Django’s MVT architecture, I established the routing and CRUD functions to make API calls to the app’s PostgreSQL database and TastyCO’s API. 

Lastly, I was responsible for implementing Django’s session-based authorization to validate user credentials.
