## Concept:

<sup>_In Canada people waste an estimated [$30 billion](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/canada-food-waste-1.3813965) of food every year._ </sup>
<br>
<sup>
_The average Canadian spends almost [$3,000 ](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110012501)every year on dining out._ </sup>
<br>
Culinarian keeps cooking simple.
<br>
With one app, you can explore and save recipes to a meal plan. Once you've planned your recipes, a grocery list is generated so you know **exactly** how much of each ingredient you need.
<br>
